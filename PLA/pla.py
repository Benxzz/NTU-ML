DATA: pla_train.dat
Question 15:
    implement a version of PLA by visiting examples in the naive cycle using the order of example in
the data set. Run the algorithm on the data set. What is the number of updates before the algorithm
halts?

Question 16:
    Implement a version of PLA by visiting examples in fixed, pre-determined random cycles throughout
the algorithm. Run the algorithm on the data set. Please repeat your experiment for 2000times, each
with a different random seed. What is the average number of updates before the algorithm halts?

Question 17:
    Implement a version of PLA by visiting examples in fixed, pre-determined random cycles throughout
the algorithm, while changing the update rule to be:
    wt+1 = wt +alpha*yn(t)xn(t)
with alpha = 0.5. Note that your PLA in the previous Question corresponds to alpha = 1.
Please repeat your experiment for 2000 times, each with a different random seed. What is the average
number of updates before the algorithm halts?
